- Orchestration using Kubernetes (Minikube)
- Configuration Management with Ansible
- CI/CD Pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Monitoring and Logging with Prometheus and Grafana
- Python scripting for database validation
- Bash scripting for automation tasks

---

## Project Objectives
- Deploy the Wanderlist app in a containerized environment
- Automate deployments using Kubernetes manifests
- Configure infrastructure tasks using Ansible
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline on GitHub Actions
- Monitor the application using Prometheus and Grafana
- Write simple Python and Bash scripts to extend automation and validation
